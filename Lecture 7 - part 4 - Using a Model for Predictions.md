# Lecture 7 - Part 3: Using a Model for Prediction

Suppose someone came to you, as an expert, now, in the trajectory of
arrows, and said, how thick a shield would I need in order to protect
myself from an archery attack?

We need to know the speed of the arrow as it reaches the target, but we didn't measure it. So we should use the data we have and predict it.

We can modify the code a little bit to print out the values for a, b, and c
for the parabolic fit.

So the equasion will be:
#### y = (-0.000069)*x**2 + (0.0755)x + 0.528

And by using that we can calculate the speed.
