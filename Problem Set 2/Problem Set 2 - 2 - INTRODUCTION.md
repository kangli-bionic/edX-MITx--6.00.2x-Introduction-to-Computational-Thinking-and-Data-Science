### INTRODUCTION

In this problem set you will practice designing a simulation and implementing a program that uses classes.

As with previous problem sets, please don't be discouraged by the apparent length of this assignment. There is quite a bit to read and understand, but most of the problems do not involve writing much code.

### GETTING STARTED

Download and save [ProblemSet2.zip](./ProblemSet2.zip "ProblemSet2.zip"): A zip file of all the files you need, including:

- ps2.py, a skeleton of the solution.

- ps2_visualize.py, code to help you visualize the robot's movement (an optional - but cool! - part of this problem set).

- ps2_verify_movement27.pyc, precompiled module for Python 2.7 that assist with the visualization code.

##### REVIEW OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING AND CLASSES

This and future problem sets will require you to know OOP. If you need a refresher, please visit these links and make sure you are familiar with these topics.

- Implementing [new classes and their attributes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap12.html "new classes and their attributes").
- Understanding [class methods](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap14.html "class methods").
- Understanding [inheritance](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap16.html "inheritance").
- Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class - recall that a class is a blueprint of an object, whilst an instance is a single, unique unit of a class.
- Utilizing libraries as black boxes.
