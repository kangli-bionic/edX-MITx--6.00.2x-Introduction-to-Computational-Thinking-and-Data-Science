### INTRODUCTION

In this problem set, you'll use Python and pylab to design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.

### GETTING STARTED

Download: [Problem Set 4 skeleton code](./ProblemSet4.zip "Problem Set 4 skeleton code").

For Problem 1 you will use the classes you implemented in Problem 4 of Problem Set 3. If you are unsure that your classes are correct you can instead import the pre-compiled implementations for these classes provided by the staff from Problem Set 3.
