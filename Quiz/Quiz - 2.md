### PROBLEM 2-1  (2 points possible)

Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard deviation of B is 5. For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a histogram with 10 bins, creating one histogram for each distribution.

-  ~~The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B.~~

-  ~~The rightmost bin of B will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of A.~~

- ~~The rightmost bin of A will have the same number of points as the rightmost bin of B.~~

- **Any of the above are possible. **

### PROBLEM 2-2  (2/2 points)

What is the exact probability of rolling at least two 6's when rolling a die three times?

- ~~1/12~~

- ~~1/36~~

- **2/27** 

- ~~25/27~~

- ~~None of the above~~

### PROBLEM 2-3  (2/2 points)

A simulation

-  ~~is useful when describing a system that cannot easily be described mathematically.~~

-  ~~is easy to successively refine.~~

- ~~can be used to extract intermediate results.~~

- **All of the above All of the above**

- ~~None of the above~~

### PROBLEM 2-4  (2/2 points)

Suppose you insert 100*N random numbers generated by random.randint(0, 99) in a hash table with 10 buckets whose hash function is h(x) = x % 10. Select the most accurate statement.

-  ~~If N = 1, each bucket in the hash table will have exactly 10 values.~~

-  ~~As N goes to infinity, the number of items in the buckets will have a Gaussian distribution across all buckets.~~

- **As N goes to infinity, the number of items in the buckets will have a uniform distribution across all buckets. **
